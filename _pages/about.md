<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

üëã I am a final year M.S. student at the Technical University of Denmark with the Full Tuition Fee Waiver (30 per year). Previously, I was an intern in computer vision at [Teton](https://www.teton.ai/) and [Volvo Cars](https://www.volvocars.com/), and I am a research assistant at [UCLA](https://www.ucla.edu/). I received my bachelor's degree from Tongji University with the Outstanding Graduate Honor and conducted research at the Institute of Intelligent Vehicles (TJU-IIV) directed by [Prof. Yanjun Huang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=r_XUM78AAAAJ) and [Prof. Hong Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=n_eA148AAAAJ&hl). 

My experience focuses on computer vision and robot learning. [**I am searching for full positions in 2025**]()
